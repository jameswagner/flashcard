      "content": "At very low temperatures quantum spin systems are viewed as quantum simulators of interacting bosons since they share several macroscopic quantum behaviors such as superﬂuidity 1 and macroscopic quantum tunneling. 2 As it was pointed out, there is an exact correspondence between a quantum antiferromagnet and a lattice Bose gas 3 and such analogy between spins and bosons has conﬁrmed to be very advantageous bringing a link to the exceptional BEC phenomenon. Moreover, the bosonic description bring an innate understanding for complex quantum behaviors which are much less intuitive in the original spin terminology. This provides new viewpoints to critical problems and, hence, contribution to the understanding of new phenomena. It has been shown that frustrated spin systems, where competing interactions cannot be simultaneously satisﬁed, oﬀer the realization of exotic phases of strongly correlated bosons such as the spin liquid phase. This frustration can be classically treated when the spin S is larger than the minimum 1 / 2 and the system is driven by thermal energy choosing a random orientation from the diﬀerent microstates and behaving as a liquid and when the temperature is small enough the spins are frozen out. But when the spin S is comparable to 1 / 2 the quantum mechanical uncertainty gives zero-point motions and the system presents quantum ﬂuctuations arriving at the quantum spin liquid, hence the spins simultaneously points in many diﬀerent directions involving wide entanglement between far a part particles. In the past, spin-3 / 2 particles were considered as high-spin particles and therefore suitable for a classical treatment. But it has been proven their quantum-mechanical behavior and, in particular, in absence of an external magnetic ﬁeld their interestingly hidden SO (5) symmetry 4 or in presence of a quadratic external ﬁeld a hidden SU (2) ⊗ SU (2) symmetry. 5 These high fermionic systems present exotic collective excitations absent in interacting electrons systems since there is an interplay between superﬂuidity and magnetism. This fact is due to the presence of diﬀerent internal states 6 reﬂected in the presence of spin-changing collisions precluded in spin-1 / 2 systems where there are solely spin-preserving collisions. Ultracold gases in optical lattices constitute an extraordinary tool for the analysis of strongly-correlated gases under extremely well-controlled conditions. 6,7 In this work, we study the magnon-like properties of repulsively Further author information: (Send correspondence to K.

We perform a Holstein-Primakoﬀtransformation to the fermionic system, expanding the spin operators in terms of the creation and annihilation operators of the harmonic oscillator, i.e. magnon-like position-operators. In this way, we obtain a spinless boson system described by an extended Bose-Hubbard model 9–11 with a hole-like lowest band. The magnon-like model involves single, pair and correlated nearest neighbors hopping terms beside the on-site and nearest neighbor interactions. Lattice bosons and several transitions occurring in these systems have been studied extensively in ultracold atomic gases in optical lattices. The magnetic phases present in the Mott-insulator of the spin-3/2 lattice fermions namely the gapless spin liquid and the gapped spin Peierls quantum phases, previously studied in Ref, 4,5,12 are analyzed in the mirror frame of their bosonic counterpart. This kind of work pave the path of revealing magnetic phases signatures in the state-of-the-art spinless boson experiments going beyond the physics of Bose-Einstein condensation and to look at the fascinating new quantum phases of interacting bosons on a lattice. The many-body numerical calculations are performed using the Matrix Product State formalism. 13",

(2) When the charge gap opens, the insulating ground-state phases are located in the repulsive interaction regime g F =0 , 2 > 0 where the Hamiltonian presents two distinct magnetic phases. In terms of the previously introduced variable g and in absence of an external ﬁeld, 12,17 the ground-state of the system for − 1 < g ≤ 0 is a gapless spin-liquid (SL) phase with three gapless spin-modes, including the exactly solvable SU (4) point ( g = 0). 18 For 0 < g < 1 the ground-state is a spin-Peierls (SP) phase, which exhibits a spin gap and long-range dimerization order. At g = 0, the system undergoes a Kosterlitz-Thouless-like transition between the two phases. 19 Proc. of SPIE Vol. 9548  954822-2 Downloaded From: http://proceedings.spiedigitallibrary.org/ on 03/14/2016 Terms of Use: http://spiedigitallibrary.org/ss/TermsOfUse.aspx",

The coeﬃcients are given by the following expressions, \u0012 t 2 t 1 = − 2 1 + g \u0013 3 , U 0 = 2 \u0012 t 2 1 + g \u0013 \u0012 t 2 , µ = 2 1 + g \u0013 2 , U 1 = 2 \u0012 1 10 t + 3 1 − g 1 + g \u0013 , 3 t 2 = − 2 \u0012 t 2 1 + g \u0013 2 \u0012 1 1 , U 2 = t − 1 − g 1 + g \u0013 . (5) The positive hopping term, t 1 , shows that we have a hole-like band, suggesting that the minima are located at ± π/a , in contrast to the particle-like band where the minimum is located at 0, where a is the lattice constant. Since the transformation is not linear and the coupling between the oscillators has important consequences for many properties of ordered systems, we calculate the ground and low lying energy states as a function of the spin-changing collision strength, g , in this magnon-like frame-work. It is worth mentioning that due to the two-sites ( i, i + 1) character of the Hamiltonian (1), it is necessary to have a special care for the single-site terms retrieved by the transformation, making them doubled in the bulk and singled in the borders. This is actually the reason why the U 0 of the bosonic Hamiltonian (4) here presented does not have the usual one half coeﬃcient to avoid further complications.",

Nevertheless, we consider this as a way to gain experience with the models and develop new strategies to approach them for longer system sizes. The retrieved data solving the bosonic system is observed in ﬁgure 3.1, where the ground-state, ﬁrst and second excited states are plotted as a function of the spin-changing collision parameter, g , in panel (a) for the spin system of section 2.1 and in panel (b) for the bosonic system of section 2.2. Panel (c) shows explicitly the comparison among the ground-states of the two models. This third panel is very interesting because of the marvelous agreement of both descriptions in the spin-liquid regime ( g ≤ 0). Before commenting about the disagreement in the dimerized region, it is important to point out that the energy scale used to present the results is of the order of 10 − 3 . In this spin- Peierls phase ( g > 0) the deviations of the bosonic model from the spin one are notorious, one can observed that the existing symmetry around g = 0 has been broken although the functional form is still conserved with the maximum energy value shifted to the right around g ∼ 0 . 6. The discrepancy in the energy is clearly originated by the truncation of the Hamiltonian and the explanation arises in the fact that this magnetic phase presents a long-range-order which means is highly correlated, therefore any missing information (even of small order) may lead to a detour of the intrinsic properties. Based on the diﬀerence between the ground-state energies of each model, we can quantize the relative error carry out by the transformation in each phase: for the spin-liquid phase there is no error whatsoever and for the spin-Peierls as can be appreciated in ﬁgure 3.1(c) is of the order of 10 − 3 for g = 0 . 6 and 10 − 6 for g = 0 . 2 .",

(b) Ground-state energy comparison between GHH and TSH, the relative error of the two consecutive transformations is shown with orange diamonds.(c) The full comparison among the three models analyzed by the two-sites problem, spin systems: GHH and TSH and bosonic system: EBHH. Commonly, this is lost as it was shown in section 3.1 due to the large amount of extra-symmetries that small systems introduce to the eigen-problem. In the ﬁgure 3.2(a) we observed that the ground-state energy together with the “ﬁrst excited” state are degenerated in the dimerized region, where g > 0. Furthermore, the energy gap, wich is the separation between these degenerated ground states with the next state, grows as the interaction parameter g increases. In the spin-liquid phase, where g < 0, it is observed a single ground state and the energy gap grows as g grows in absolute value. This indicates that the energy gap in both magnetic phases depends strongly on the interaction strength in both spin-channels. In the dimerized spin-Peierls phase, the energy gap grows as the interaction strength of channel F = 2 ( g 2 ) is bigger than the channel F = 0 ( g 0 ). Whereas in the spin-liquid phase the opposite occurs, and the gap opens when the g 0 strength is stronger. In panel (b), it is shown the ground states for the two studied spin systems: the Heisenberg (red crosses) and the truncated (blue asterisks) models, additionally, the diﬀerence among them is also presented by orange diamonds. The discrepancy is minimal where the super-exchange interaction vanishes, g = 0, showing that the lost of information provided by the Holstein-Primakoﬀtransformation does not play major role at the lack of g and all models mirror each other. Elsewhere the strong dependency with the interactions makes unfaithful the models upto three orders of magnitude, although keeping the data functional form. In panel (c), we present the ground-state energy for the three systems under consideration, GHH, EBHH and TSH. We had seen that the transformation to bosonic operators maintains the ground-state energy value in the spin-liquid regime. Nevertheless, a further inverse transformation to spins shows a rising energy and therefore some information is lost in this phase. On the other hand, in the dimerized spin-Peierls phase both models EBHH and TSH present ground-state energy values very close to each other and, what is more, the values tend to be close to the GHH values for g ≤ 0 . 5, suggesting that for larger values of g (still smaller than one), the models resemble each other again.",

Momentum distribution as a function of the super-exchange interaction strength g , (a) in the spin-liquid phase, g < 0, and (b) in the dimerized spin-Peierls phase, g > 0. Furthermore, in absence of spin-changing collisions, g = 0, the minima are obtained at k cl = ± arccos( − J ′ / 4) as it is expected following. 21 In the present system J ′ = − t 1 /S , see ﬁgure 3. The bosons tend to condensate at the minimum of the single-particle dispersion since they experience a minimal repulsion there. In ﬁgure 3, one can appreciate how the position of this minimum changes as a function of g . It is shown in panel (a) that the minimum position is located where k cl < π/ 2, in panel (b) we see that in absence of spin-changing collisions, g = 0, the minima are at k cl = π/ 2 ± 2 π and panel (c) shows one minimum at k cl = π . It is relevant the case of g ≤ 0 where permanently there are two minima. To look in more detail this magnon dispersion-relation behavior in the system, we have perform numerical calculations using the Matrix Product States (MPS) formalism 13 with 60 sites, open boundary conditions, and matrix dimension 20. The momentum distribution for the magnon system in the two distinct phases as a function of g are presented in ﬁgure 4. In panel 4(a) we can appreciate that in the window − 1 ≲ g < − 0 . 6 the system presents two minima in the dispersion as was suggested in the classical case (ﬁgures 3(a) and 3(b)) but these minima move to each other and meet at k = π around g ∼− 0 . 5 and henceforth there is solely one minimum until the end of the dimerized phase g ≲ 1.",

It is shown in panel (a) that the minimum position is located where k cl < π/ 2, in panel (b) we see that in absence of spin-changing collisions, g = 0, the minima are at k cl = π/ 2 ± 2 π and panel (c) shows one minimum at k cl = π . It is relevant the case of g ≤ 0 where permanently there are two minima.",

      "content": "In conclusion, the position-space magnons obtained, by means of the Holstein-Primakoﬀtransformation from a repulsively interacting spin − 3 / 2 fermions, shows a high-quality energy spectrum, for the ground and low-lying states, in comparison with the original spin system for the two-sites problem. The magnon-like spectrum resem- bles the functional form and the energy-scale showing the reproducibility in actual spinless-bosons experiments. We show that the validity of the transformation increases in absence of spin-changing collisions processes, this point corresponds to the spin-liquid phase. On the other hand the transformation has also a high validity then the super-exchange interaction is positive and close to its maximal value, corresponding to the dimerized spin- Peierls phase. The accuracy of the transformation is strongly link to the fermionic hopping parameter t and the deeper the spin-3 / 2 systems is in the Mott-insulator regime, the truthful the transformation is. We have also study the magnon dispersion-relation behavior in the classical limit as M. Arlego et. al. 21 and the exact case by means of the MPS formalism and conclude that in the spin-liquid phase the dispersion-relation presents two minima emphasizing the liquid nature of this phase, and one minimum exclusively in the spin- Peierls phase. The two minima at the gapless phase do not persist all the way up to g = 0 as the classical picture suggests but they cease around g ∼− 0 . 5 where they merge and stick together up to the far end ( g ≲ 1) of the dimerized phase.
