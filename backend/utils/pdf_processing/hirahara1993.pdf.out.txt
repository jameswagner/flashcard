Vol. 71, No. 2 PERMEABILITY INHIBITION BY FXIII 141 Preparation of anti-guinea pig endothelial cell antiserum Guinea pig endothelial cells were isolated from the main artery and vena cava(l6), then cells were inoculated into tissue culture dishes and incubated for several days with Dulbecco MEM containing 15% FCS and 37.5 pg/ml ECGS till reaching confluency. Confluent monolayer was harvested by a cell scraper. The cells were rinsed twice with Dulbecco phosphate buffered saline(pH 7.2). These cells were used as an antigen for the production of anti-endothelial cell antiserum. The antiserum was obtained from rabbits immunized with emulsion of Freund's complete adjuvant with guinea pig endothelial cells, and boosted with emulsion of Freund's incomplete adjuvant. After several times of boosting, the antibody titer was measured with guinea pig endothelial cells by the methods of cytolysis and indirect immunofluorescence microscopy using FITC conjugated anti-rabbit IgG(17). Measurement of antibody titer of anti-endothelial cell antiserum Confluent monolayer of guinea pig endothelial cells in a 96-well plate was incubated with 50 ~1 of variously diluted antiserum in Dulbecco MEM-15% FCS for 30 min. The medium was then replaced to 50 11 of 5% guinea pig complement in Dulbecco MEM-15% FCS and the cells were further incubated for 30 min. After addition of 10 ~1 of trypan blue solution, the cell layers were photographed to evaluate the extent of cell lysis. Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy was done as follows. The antiserum was serially diluted two times. The diluted antiserum was then incubated with the main artery at room temperature for 1 hour and rinsed 3 times with Dulbecco phosphate buffer. After washing, lOOO-fold dilution of FITC conjugated anti-rabbit IgG was added to the sections, incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature, and washed 3 times with Dulbecco phosphate buffer. All sections were observed by a Nikon microscope equipped with a mercury lamp. The titer was taken as a highest dilution which gave a fluorescent staining just above the background staining of normal serum controls. Duration of activity of permeability enhancement Measurement of permeability was studied according to Yamamoto et al. (18) . A 100 ~1 portion of 50-fold diluted antiserum was intradermally injected into the back of a guinea pig before intravenous injection of 0.5 ml of 1 % Evans blue. After 15 minutes of the Evans blue injection, the back skins were harvested and the blue lesions were observed.

As a result, the 50% cytolysis was observed by the 60-fold dilution of antiserum, and the fluorescence was observed by 400-fold dilution. The antiserum exhibited the reactivity with not only guinea pig but also human endothelial cells. However it did not react with guinea pig fibroblasts. When the cryosection of the main artery of a guinea pig was used for the indirect immunofluorescence test, the fluorescence was observed on the inner membrane which was seemed to be endothelial cell. It was also found that the antiserum reacted with the extracellular matrix proteins produced by endothelial cells(data not shown). Enhanced permeability First, we studied whether this antiserum induced the permeability in guinea pigs. The variation of permeability after intradermal injection is shown in Fig. 1. The permeability reached the maximum within 5 minutes. This activity for enhancing the permeability almost disappeared within 30 minutes after the injection. This permeability enhancing phenomenon was classified as a short lasting reaction. We next investigated the dose response of this antiserum. As shown in Fig. 2, the activity of",
